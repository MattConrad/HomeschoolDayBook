1.1.1  2021-03-25:
holy cow. more than 10 years since the last major change.
removed all the licensing and licensing related stuff. still builds, still seems to run.
can we still run the setup packager? it's been a long time.


1.0.10 (dbv 1.00) 2010-12-13:
added "some" support for higher DPI settings, by adding a scaling 
setting to frcAttendance:InitDayControlsForTablePanel().
to allow custom scaling, had to add a new system setting, which in turn 
required many new changes to SystemSettings.cs (see header comments there).
small tweak to CEDBHandler comments.
some changes to frcSystemSettings.cs, nothing suprising.

1.0.09 "b" (dbv 1.00) 2010-12-13:
I always thought "b" releases were stupid and here I am doing one.
I'm on a new machine that does not have the "complete" Krypton toolkit installation, so I added a \lib folder
with the Krypton DLL and changed the reference from the "big" .NET assembly cache to the \lib folder.
Also, I had to uncheck the "sign the ClickOnce manifests" box in project properties--Signing before the 
project would build on the new machine.
This should NOT change anything important about the .exe, and indeed the byte size is identical between the 
previous build and today's build. I do not think I need to do a new official release.
But just in case something subtle ends up broken, I mention these changes here.

1.0.9   (dbv 1.00)  2010-05-20:
changed the following queries:
_sqcGetDTitlesByDateRange
_sqcGetDTitlesByTargetDate
_sqcGetREntriesByDate
to explicitly order by entry_id after other orderings applied.  this is to fix a weird case
with Cindy V-T where her 19th entry started at the top of the daily list.
decided to order by entry_id rather than insert_datetime bc system clock glitches could make things "weird"
and entry_id should be safer in that regard.

1.0.8   (dbv 1.00)  2010-03-15:
altered error handling to post to PHP page instead of sending email via gmail.
added extra instructions to Manage Entries page.
added extra instructions to Choose Reports page.

1.0.7   (dbv 1.00)  2009-04-13:
added a history feature to frmDayBookEntry.txtTitle.
put a MaxLength on frmDayBookEntry.txtTitle and MaxLengths in all the wizard popups.  oops!
tiny Vista-improvement layout change

1.0.6   (dbv 1.00)  2009-03-29:
added backup and restore feature.
also, tweaked schedule for autobackups.
also, tweaked frcDayBookEntry Save-and-Next to set focus to entry title (rather than date).

added setting "DatabaseVersion" to uc_settings.  obviously, cannot add to previous versions.
did NOT add auto-insert code for when not present.  instead, BackupRestore.cs checks 
for absence of this setting and fakes it to "1.00" if it isn't found.

since BackupRestore.cs is currently the only place this setting is used, this is OK for now.
later, we may need to add auto-insert code.


1.0.5   2009-03-21:
argh!  fixing date localization broke ordering on at least one report. now fixed.
decided to increment version #, maybe someone downloaded 1.0.4.

1.0.4   2009-03-19:
Guess what?  Canadians use dd/MM/yyyy formatting for dates.  And it crashed attendance & reports in 1.0.3.
Improved date localization.  Is a little tricky, nearly missed a bug, but I think I got em all.
Several revisions to reports.  Time Spent Per Date by kid has ugly expression you may need later.
Key reporting tricks:  
	reports must have Language defined as "=User!Language".
	in a report, =DateTime1.Value.ToString also shows time (useless, ugly), but ="" & DateTime1.Value
		shows date only, which is what we want.

1.0.3   2009-03-12
added Environment.OSVersion.VersionString to exception catching, started using x.ToString() in exception
reporting (it contains inner exception info), revised exception handling to still report in case
of database disasters (previously, exception reporting gave up if no sys settings).

1.0.2	2009-03-02
Fixed bug in frcChooseReports where new kids & subjects were not applied w/out restart.

1.0.1    2009-03-01
Recompiled with to x86 only, attempting to force WOW use and fix crashes on Vista 64.
Also added copyright notice to frcSystemSettings.
Made tiny change to EULA.txt (added line break).

1.0.0	 2009-02-28
Initial public release.
