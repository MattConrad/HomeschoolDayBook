# HomeschoolDayBook

This is the repo for the homeschool record keeping application Homeschool Day Book.

For several years I sold Homeschool Day Book as a side project. It tried to be the simplest and easiest homeschool record keeper on the market and it had a small but devoted following.

I haven't worked on Day Book for a long time and it's pretty antiquated at this point. It's better off now as open source and freely available.

If all you want to do is run the program, there's a /setup folder with a DayBookSetup.exe install package.

If you want to work with the source code, be warned that there are references to the Microsoft Reporting tools and the SQL Server CE libraries that are rather old and may cause a little headache. If you get stuck on this let me know and I'll try to help out: I'm not really expecting anyone to do much with this project so I'm not worrying about it for now.
