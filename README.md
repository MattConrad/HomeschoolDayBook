# HomeschoolDayBook

This is the repo for the homeschool record keeping application Homeschool Day Book.

For several years I sold Homeschool Day Book as a side project. It tried to be the simplest and easiest homeschool record keeper on the market and it had a small but devoted following.

I haven't worked on Day Book for a long time and it's pretty antiquated at this point. It's better off now as open source and freely available.

If all you want to do is run the program, there's a /setup folder with a DayBookSetup.exe install package.
